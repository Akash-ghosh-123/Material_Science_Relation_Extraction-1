The Fe2O3 / 3DGN composite demonstrated an impressive capacity of 864 mA h g 1 in the 50th cycle , which was extremely superior to pure Fe2O3 ( 24.3 mA h g 1 ) , benefiting from the excellent electrical conductivity of 3DGN ( Fig .
The b-LiVOPO4 / LaPO4 samples delivered an initial discharge capacity of about 127.0 mA h g 1 at 0.1 C and possessed favorable capacities at rates of 0.5 and 1 C. Therefore , surface modification of crystalline LaPO4 is an effective way to improve the electrochemical performance of bLiVOPO4 .
During the first discharge , the voltage profile shows a voltage plateau at around 1.1 V , which is consistent with the earlier CV profiles arising from the irreversible SnO2 reduction and SEI formation .
Note that the C-coated hollow SnO2 array electrode shows a considerably higher initial coulombic efficiency ( 58.8 % ) than the pristine hollow SnO2 ( 52.4 % ) and SnO2 nanopowders ( 33.0 % ) ( Table S1 of the ESI { ) .

This technique allows the initial coulombic efficiency as high as 94.9 % without sacrificing the structural stability of SiOx at all throughout cycling .
By limiting the upper cutoff voltage to 1.0 V instead of 1.5 V with the same 0.2 C rate , the SnO2 NP electrode can maintain a capacity of 500 mAh g 1 up to 50 cycles ( Fig .
We believe this implies that even when the upper cutoff voltage is limited to 1.0 V , the decomposition of Li2O is inhibited but not prevented , which may explain the delayed onset of capacity fading for the SnO2 NP electrode .

The large initial irreversible capacity is mainly related to the side reactions that occur at the voltage around 1.5 V to form the SEI film , and to the irreversible reaction of Li ions and sulfur to form Li2S .
Another possible way is to widen the voltage window , because when the voltage was increased to 2.0 V , the Li2S would decompose and the irreversible reaction between Li and S would become partially reversible [ 20 ] .
When the calcinations time is 20 h , 30 h and 40 h , the discharge capacity of LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 electrode is 85.25 mAh g 1 , 105.21 mAh g 1 and 77.46 mAh g 1 , and coulombic efficiency is 65.0 % , 67.44 % and 73.6 % .

7 , it can be seen that Li4Ti5O12 shows a gradual loss of the 1.55 V plateau with increasing the cycling number at low-rate charge–discharge ( 0.1 C ) , and this may be due to the low discharge voltage ( discharged to 0 V ) .
During discharge , solid PbO / PbOx is converted to Pb2+ ions at 1.8 V first , before PbO2 is at 2.0 V. This creates the two discharge voltage levels .
The voltage of the cell hen decreases from 0.5 V and slowly down to 0 V. This is similar to the first charge–discharge curve of GeO2 compounds [ 30 ] .

In addition , the rate of ammonia synthesis increased as the applied voltage increased to 2.0 V , and the maximum rate was achieved using RuO2 / PANI / N-MWCNT .
The disadvantage of the battery is the relatively low output voltage of 0.3 V for a single exible battery that is much lower than the theoretical value of 1.8 V using a LiFePO4 cathode and a Li4Ti5O12 anode .
Obviously , the larger energy density of LiMn0.8Fe0.2PO4 / C mainly comes from the higher average discharge voltage ( w 4 V ) , about 0.6 V higher than that of LiFePO4 / C .
Among them , LiMnPO4 was widely investigated due to promising electrochemical features , such as a specific capacity comparable to LiFePO4 and working voltage of 4.1 V vs. Liþ / Li , and a higher theoretical energy density ( 700Wh kg 1 ) [ 17 ] .

Name . , 2012 , 00 , 1-3 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 addition , the modern nanotechnology has been employed to prepare many metal oxides with various morphologies and structures for Li cycling as anode materials for LIBs.7 As a result , the research on metal oxides as anodes for LIBs has been enhanced and enriched very significantly in recent years.8 Among the metal oxides as anode materials for LIBs , Mnbased oxides have obvious advantages because of their high specific capacities , lower toxicity , cost , and operating voltage ( average discharge and charge voltages of 0.5 V and 1.2 V vs. Li / Li+ , respectively ) comparing with the iron,33-35 cobalt36-38 and Ni-based oxides.39-40 Table 1 listed the experimental values of the plateaus potential and theoretical specific capacities associated with conversion reactions in Mn-based oxides.41-45 In a Li / MnxO half-cell , the electrochemical processes can be summarized by the equation below : MnOx + 2xLi + + 2xe− ↔ Mn + xLi2O This reaction for Li storage in Mn-based oxides based on the “ conversion mechanism ” has four major obstacles for practical applications:29 ( 1 ) the strong structural reorganization that takes place to accommodate the chemical changes and induces large volume changes , resulting in severe particle agglomeration and unsatisfactory cycling performance ; ( 2 ) low rate performance arising from their low conductivity ; ( 3 ) an unacceptable large voltage hysteresis , in term of round-trip energy density loss , which is observed between the discharge and charge steps ; and ( 4 ) a virtually ubiquitous large coulombic inefficiency observed in the first cycle .
They have also demonstrated that the C / MnO-L nanocomposites have a lower voltage hysteresis ( < 0.7 V with a charging voltage of 1.2 V ) , during the discharge / charge cycles compared to other metal oxides .
In each case , the current rate was 0.2 C. These profiles show that the composite material is associated with awider voltage plateau at 3.4 V than that of the pristine LiFePO4 .

Therefore , it is of great importance to develop new cathode materials with a large capacity , high working voltage , excellent safety , and good cycling life.4 Among the vast number of reported cathode materials , NASICON-structured monoclinic Li3V2 ( PO4 ) 3 ( LVP ) has drawn much attention , because of an average 4.0 V ( ~0.6 V higher than LiFePO4 ) extraction / reinsertion voltage obtained between 3.0 and 4.8 V , a higher theoretical capacity of 197 mAh g-1 for the complete removal of three Li+ ions , and higher lithium ion diffusion coefficient of 10-9-10-10 cm2 s-1 compared with LiFePO4 ( 10 -14-10-16 cm2 s-1 ) .5-7 However , the main drawback of pure LVP is its very low intrinsic electronic conductivity ( 2.4×10-7 s cm-1 at room temperature ) , low ionic conductivity and fast capacity fading at high voltage ( > 4.6 V ) , which causes high electrode polarization and restricts its practical application.8-12 Nowadays , numerous strategies have been carried out to solve the above problems of Li3V2 ( PO4 ) 3 , such as metal ion doping 13-27 , surface coating with carbon28-30 , oxide introduction31-35 , particle size reducing36-39 and controlling particle morphologies40-44 .
In the first-discharge profile , the voltage fades dramatically to 1.1 V with a long flat plateau , and then it continuously decreases to cut-off voltage of 0.01 V. Such a specific variation should be ascribed to the conversion of Co3O4 with lithium into Co and Li2O .

See DOI : hemistry 2017 materials exhibit remarkable electrochemical performance unlike spinel LiMn2O4 as the Mn 4+ ion in LNMO suppresses the manganese dissolution and Jahn–Teller distortion , which is mostly ascribed to the Mn3+ ion in spinel-based materials.6,7 Although the ideal LiNi0.5 2+Mn1.5 4+O4 with an ordered structure ( P4332 space group ) would maximize the utilization of the Ni2+ / Ni4+ redox couple during electrochemical reactions owing to suppressed Mn dissolution or Jahn–Teller distortion , LNMO materials with some cation disorder are known to be more advantageous because of the presence of Mn3+ and consequent improvement in the conductivity and stable longterm cycling performance.2 The presence of Mn3+ additionally provides an increased number of electron hopping pathways in addition to the contribution from the increased hopping carriers themselves.8 In this regard , the partial substitution of Ni / Mn by foreign atoms9–11 or control of annealing time or cooling rate and an additional post-annealing process12–14 have been successfully employed to introduce Mn3+ ions into the spinel lattice ; however , an excessive increase of Mn3+ ions sacrices the energy density or causes Mn3+-related issues such as Mn dissolution or Jahn–Teller distortion.7 Another main drawback to utilizing the high-voltage spinel LNMO cathode is the undetermined side reaction between the cathode and the electrolyte because the conventional electrolyte system comprising LiPF6-based salts and carbonate-based solvents can not cover the high operating voltage of the LNMO cathodes ( 4.7 V ) .15–17 Electrolyte decomposition in a highly oxidative atmosphere , which is the most serious problem for the 5 V high voltage spinel , intensies at elevated J .
