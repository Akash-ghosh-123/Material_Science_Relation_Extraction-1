See DOI : Chemistry 2015 Among various Co-based multicomponent TMOs , ZnCo2O4 anode materials have received special attention because of their unique crystalline structure and remarkable electrochemical reaction mechanism toward lithium ions.14–19 In the cubic spinel structure , the bivalent Zn-ions occupy the tetrahedral sites and the trivalent Co-ions hold the octahedral sites.20 The heterogeneous cationic substitution could lead to multiple valence states at these multi-metal centres and reduce the activation energy for electron transport between cations , and thus generally endow desirable electronic conductivity.8,21 Different from other multicomponent TMOs , ZnCo2O4 anodes can reversibly react with lithium mainly by the conversion reaction between the Zn / Co species and Li along with the possible Li–Zn alloying / de-alloying mechanism.15,18,22–24 Consequently , a multi-electron reversible reaction ( 7.0 or 8.33 e ) could take place during the charge–discharge cycle achieving a high specic capacity.20,25 Song and co-authors reported a ake-byake ZnCo2O4 anode , which delivered a high discharge capacity of 1458.5 mA h g 1.26 Giri et al .
