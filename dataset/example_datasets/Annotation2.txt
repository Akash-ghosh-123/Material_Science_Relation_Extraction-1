1|||Multivalent magnesium batteries are viable candidates for post Li-ion technology due to the high volumetric capacity of the Mg metal anode (3833 mAh cm-3), high natural abundance, good safety characteristics and low equilibrium potential (-2.31 V vs Hydrogen).|||Mg|||3833 mAh cm-3|||capacity

2|||Since this is the first report on the magnesiation of amorphous V2O5-P2O5, we can only compare the initial discharge capacity to sputtered-V2O5 (180 mAh g-1), nanocrystalline V2O5 (180 mAh g-1), and the lithiation V2O5-P2O5 (>200 mAh g-1).|||V2O5|||180 mAh g-1|||capacity
