For rechargeable lithium ion batteries ( LIBs ) , safety issues are a concern for their application , especially in large batteries for electric vehicles ( EVs ) , hybrid electric vehicles ( HEVs ) and other load-leveling applications.1–3 The carbonaceous anodematerials commonly used currently have high resistance at the electrode / electrolyte interface for high-rate performance , leading to kinetic problems for LIBs.4 Spinel-type Li4Ti5O12 ( LTO ) is promising as an anode material for LIBs due to its very at voltage plateau at around 1.55 V vs. Li / Li+ , avoiding the reduction of electrolytes , and its zero-strain in the cubic lattice during electrochemical cycling , resulting in a good specic capacity and capacity retention.5,6 Although LTO is more stable and safer than carbonaceous materials like graphite , its poor intrinsic electronic conductivity ( < 10 13 S m 1 ) leads to a low specic capacity and rate capability.7,8 Doping metal ions like Al3+ , V5+,9,10 reducing the particle size11–13 or adding conductive carbon have been commonly used to improve the intrinsic electronic conductivity and rate capability of hristian University , 200 Chung-Pei Rd . , 3 , Republic of China .

The reported reaction mechanisms of the LMRO cathode materials include : ( 1 ) mechanism of oxygen release ; ( 2 ) mechanism of surface reaction ; ( 3 ) mechanism of peroxide reaction and ( 4 ) mechanism of proton exchange.13,27–31 The high initial irreversible capacity of the LMRO cathode materials mainly originate from the activation of the Li2MnO3 component at high voltages over 4.5 V , which causes the discharge capacity to decrease by 20–30 % that of the charge capacity.32 The side reaction of the interphase between the cathode surface and the electrolyte , especially at high cutoff charge voltages over 4.6 V , is another reason leading to its initial irreversible capacity.33,34 It is generally accepted that the phase transformation from layered to spinel structure occurs when the LMRO cathodes are charged to 4.8 V.30,35,36 The gradual growth of the spinel phase results in voltage fading and capacity decay during cycling.37 The dissolution of metal elements in the electrolyte also gives rise to capacity / voltage fading.38 The low conductivity of LiMO2 and Li2MnO3 oxides is one of the main reasons causing the poor rate capability of the LMRO cathode materials.39–42 It has also been reported that the activity of the Li2MnO3 phase could damage the electrode surface structure which increases its interfacial impedance and decreases the Li+ ions ' diffusion kinetics , which also severely causes the poor rate capability of the LMRO cathode materials.43–45 Representative modification methods including chemical activation , doping / substitution , and surface coating are used to overcome these issues of high initial irreversible capacity , poor cycle life , fast voltage fading , and poor rate capability of the LMRO cathode materials .

exhibited the superior electrochemical properties with a specic capacity of 804.6 mA h g 1 at a current density of 100 mA g 1 aer 100 cycles and the CE was less than 50 % .22 However , these Ca2Ge7O16 electrodes had relatively low CE and short cycling life under a lower current density ( 100 mA g 1 ) due to the pulverization caused by the volume expansion and poor electronic conductivity .
prepared different structural FeNbO4 using the conventional solid state method and carbon-coated monoclinic FeNbO4 exhibited the highest capacity of 125.5 mA h g 1 after 50 cycles [ 11 ] .
low initial coulombic efficiency of TiO2 ( only 50.9 % ) .
The 3D printed SnO2 QDs / graphene architectures exhibit impressive electrochemical performance with an ultrahigh specic reversible capacity of 991.6 mA h g 1 , making them superior to all reported 3D printing electrodes to date .
The first discharge / charge capacity of ZnSnO3 is 1022 / 416 mA h g -1 with a low Coulombic efficiency of 40.7 % .
The LiFePO4 / 3 wt % CNTs / C composite delivers 149.4 mA h g 1 at 1C rate and retains a capacity of 143.0 mA h g 1 ( 96 % ) when the C-rate is increased from 1C to 2C .
The specic discharge capacity is 119.8 mA h g 1 ( 82 % ) for the LiFePO4 / 3 wt % CNTs / C composite , while the pristine LiFePO4 / C only shows a specic capacity of 84.0 mA h g 1 ( 61 % ) when the C-rate is 10C .
The investigation in cycling performances demonstrates that Si / Li2TiO3 exhibits the improved cycling stability , with specific capacity of 471.0 mA h g 1 after 50 cycles and the capacity retention is 31.5 % , much higher than pure Si .

The pristine LiMn2O4 material delivers the highest specic discharge capacity of 124.4 mA h g 1 with the initial columbic efficiency of 97.6 % .
They can store charges through faradaic reactions , so most of them have remarkable theoretical specific capacitances that are substantially higher than the capacitances of carbon materials.14-16 However , most transition metal oxides have poor electrical conductivities , which is detrimental to their rate capabilities and limits their capacitances during fast charging and discharging.17 For example , TiO2 has a fairly low electrical conductivity of about 10-7 S cm-1 , which results in more than 80 % capacitance decay when the scan rate increased from 10 to 1000 mV s-1.18,19 Another example is MoO3 that has a low conductivity of about 0.06 S cm-1 , causing almost 70 % capacitance lost when the current density increased from 0.5 A g-1 to 10 A g-1.20 Besides , sluggish ion diffusion also poses a barrier to power density ( capability of fast charging and discharging ) of both carbon and transition metal oxide based supercapacitors.17 To improve the capacitive performance of carbon and metal oxide based materials , a variety of chemical methods have been implemented to activate these SC electrodes .
